20+ years experience in building scalable data products.

I started writing software in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) and [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) when I was a kid. I continued in assembly and C as a teenager. The day I started grad school, I was the only one in the class using Linux. During my studies I co-founded [Tixeo](https://www.tixeo.com) of which I was the CTO for 10 years.

Nowadays, I apply software engineering best practices to Machine Learning.
